# STAT386_Semester_Project
This is a class project where I do data analysis of yoyos

Background: I am the president of the Yoyo Club at BYU. I have been yoyoing for 14 years. I have never seen a dataset about yoyos, and think this would be useful information for yoyo players.

Process:

First, I coded a webcrawler/scraper as found in 'yoyo_crawler.py' to create my raw data file 'yoyo_raw_data.csv' from different yoyo listings on yoyoexpert.com. This dataset ended up being over 500 lines long. It has 12 different features (excluding overlapping ones like width in inches/width in mm). 

I then cleaned the data and performed EDA to look at different relationships between variables.

I finished this project by creating a Streamlit dashboard which can be found here:

I also worte 2 blog posts about my journey which can be found at these links:

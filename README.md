# STAT386_Semester_Project
This is a class project where I do data analysis of yoyos

Background: I am the president of the Yoyo Club at BYU. I have been yoyoing for 14 years. I have never seen a dataset about yoyos, and think this would be useful information for yoyo players.

Process:

First I coded a webcrawler/scraper as found in 'yoyo_crawler.py' to create my raw data file 'yoyo_raw_data.csv' from different yoyo listing on yoyoexpert.com

Then, in Beginning_EDA I started to clean the data and look at different relationships between variables. I'm interested in what variables affect price.
